["ideas.html", "Ideas What’s Markdown? What’s R Markdown? And where I do this?", " Ideas What’s Markdown? Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authorship of HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Your differential lies is the facility to read and write documents. In summary, Markdown is: A simple text formatting syntax; A software tool, written in Perl1, that converts simples text formatting in HTML. Typing “online markdown editor” in Google you can found several different websites that allow you, online, to create, edit, compile and save our Markdown file in different extentions (HTML, pdf) and making connections with Dropbox, GitHub, etc. What’s R Markdown? R Markdown is a markdown that recognize R code. Inside a rmd file you can insert R code. And where I do this? A Markdown file has the extention .md, and can be created and edited in any programming language editor. The same with R Markdown (.rmd extention), if you are able to run R in this editor. You can use the “pure” R, without any editor. You can use Emacs, Vim, Sublime, etc. But, for rmd files the most friendly interface is RStudio. Perl is an programming language very used in UNIX systems administratives tasks, web development, finances, www form programming and bioinformatic, also having very efficient functions for text manipulation.↩ "],
["first-steps.html", "First steps YAML header Basic things in Markdown", " First steps If you are using a editor that’s not RStudio, you need to create a file with the extention .Rmd and open the file is this editor (or create the file in the editor and save with this extention, the final result is the same). You can do this also in RStudio, but RStudio provide to you another way. In the first menu option (first option in the up left), you have the options to easily create a Rmd file (and others types of files and applications2). Important To use all the R Markdown features you need the R package rmarkdown. To install the package you only need to run: install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) And to load: library(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) YAML header YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. For each programming language you can find the respective YAML project. In simple documents you don’t need to create or use a YAML header, but in general is a good thing to do. YAML: A YAML header explains what type of document to build from your R Markdown file. A YAML header is a set of key: value pairs at the start of your file. Begin and end the header with a line of three dashes (- - -). Example: ___ title: &quot;My first R Markdown document&quot; author: &quot;Muhammad Lee&quot; output: htm_document ___ Everything that you write inside the YAML is called “metadata”. The output value determines which type of file R will build from your .Rmd file: output: html_document \\(\\Rightarrow\\) html file (web page) output: pdf_document \\(\\Rightarrow\\) pdf document output: word_document \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Microsoft Word .docx output: beamer_document \\(\\Rightarrow\\) beamer slideshow (pdf) output: ioslides_document \\(\\Rightarrow\\) ioslides slideshow (html) Here HTML and here PDF you can found several available YAML options for html and pdf documents. Basic things in Markdown Titles If you wanna create a big title, generally the principal title of your document, you only need to put a # before the title (if you use the YAML option “title” you are already doing this). If you put a double hash mark (##) you will create a section, if put three will create a subsection. The maximum is four. Lists To create a list you only need to put a * or a number (1, 2, 3, …) followed by a point, or a dashe, all followed by a space. Images To insert a image you need to use the command ![](~/path/of/the/image.jpg). Links To create a link you have to use [Desired link name](http://www.desired-address.com). Tables Create a table in Markdown isn’t complicated, but you still can use a online table generator. In this way you can see the results of your table in real time and copy after the code to your file. In the internet you can find several, like this. Searching for “markdown tutorial” in Google you can find easily several pages showing how create other things in Markdown, like how to put phrases in italic, bold, blockquotes, etc. In Markown you can also insert \\(\\LaTeX\\) and HTML raw code. Take some time to discovery by yourself this things. Is very simple and intuitive.↩ "],
["others-languages.html", "Others languages LaTeX R Others", " Others languages LaTeX You can use raw \\(\\LaTeX\\)’s code normally in Markdown documents. If you wanna insert a \\(\\LaTeX\\)’s code inline, you just need to insert the code between \\( \\) or $ $. Por example, \\(f(x) = x^{2}\\) will generate \\(f(x) = x^{2}\\). For insert a equation you just need to insert the code between \\[ \\] or $$ $$. Por example, \\[ f(x) = x^{2}. \\] will generate \\[ f(x) = x^{2}. \\] Everything that you do in a .tex file you are able to do into a .rmd file. If you need to use a different package, you can load this package in the YAML header, inserting then in this way: header-includes: - \\usepackage{package_name} - \\usepackage{other_package} Important: To work, you have to respect the code indentation. R To insert R code you have to put your code into a environment called chunk. Before your code you need to put three ` followed by {r}. After, to close the environment you have to put more three. Inside the chunk all te code is interpreted like R code. In the RStudio you already have a button to insert chunks. Into the chunk, after the letter r that you have to put, you can insert several options. Por example, if you don’t wanna that the source code appear, use the option echo=FALSE. You wanna that the code appear but not the result? results='hide'. You have options for resize images, image captions, etc. You have several options for several things. All this options make part of Knitr, this will be shown in the next section. Here you can see an list with all this options and how to use them. Inside ` followed by the letter r, you are able to insert inline R code. Others For insert other languages, the procedure is exactly the same that for R. If you wanna insert Bash code, you have to put {bash}; Python code? Put {python}; SQL? Put {sql}; Stan? Put {stan}; Etc. "],
["knitr.html", "knitr", " knitr The knitr package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, and solve some long-standing problems in Sweave. If you are working in a .tex file but wanna insert R code, knitr is a very good alternative. This extention is .Rnw. In a .Rnw file, by default, everything that you write is interpreted as in a .tex file. In reality, you do everything like in a \\(\\LaTeX\\) document. The only difference is wanna you want insert R code. For insert R code you have to create a chunk like this: &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;= @ Everything typed outside a chunk is rendered as \\(\\LaTeX\\) code, everything inside a chunk is rendered as R code. The same chunk options shown in the previous section can be used here. In reality, all this options was created to use in a .Rnw file. Here you can see an list with all this options and how to use them. "],
