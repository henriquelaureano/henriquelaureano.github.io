**All tihis code below is [R](https://www.r-project.org/) = )**

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)

opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE
               , cache.path="cache/"
               , fig.path="iBagens/"
               , dpi=100
               , fig.align="center"
               , comment=NA

               , error=FALSE

```

## Dataset

***

```{r}
path <- "C:/Users/henri/GitHub/mynameislaure.github.io/tarantino/"

da <- read.csv(paste0(path, "tarantino.csv")) ; summary(da)
```

> We have two events of interest: death or a curse, when it's a
  death, words are not said

> The dataset is composed of seven movies

***

## Wordcloud

***

```{r, fig.height=2.75}
library(wordcloud)

freq <- as.data.frame(table(subset(da, type == "word")$word))

names(freq)[1] <- "Word"

wordcloud(freq$Word, freq$Freq, min.freq = 1
          , col = 1:5)
```

> When the event is death no word is said

> We can classify curse words into four groups, based on the
  frequencies at which they are used. Each group is given by a
  different color

> The most spoken word, fucking, distances itself so much from the
  others in terms of frequency that it alone forms a group

> The second most common (most used) group consists of the words:
  n-word, fuck and shit

> The third most common group consists of the words: ass and
  goddamn

> `r length(levels(freq$Word)) - 1` words are spoken

***

## Minutes

***

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=11, results='hide'}
library(latticeExtra)

minutes.plot <- function(name, xl, yl, number){
  xyplot(
    ts(subset(da, movie %in% name)$minutes_in)

django <-
  minutes.plot(
    "Django Unchained", seq(0, 300, 75), seq(0, 160, 40), 309)

print(caes, c(0, 2/3, 1/3, 1), more = TRUE)

print(django, c(1/3, 0, 2/3, 1/3))

library(grid)
draw.key(list(text = list(c("Curse word", "A death"))
              , lines = list(col = c("#0080ff", 2))
              , border = TRUE, padding.text = 5
              ), draw = TRUE, vp = viewport(x = .18, y = .17)
         )
```

**Among the things that we can say from the graphics above we
  have:**

> The longest movie is probably Django Unchained and the
  shortest is Reservoir Dogs

> The movie with most events is Pulp Fiction, 476 and the one
  with less is Kill Bill: Vol. 2, 80

> The movie with most deaths is Kill Bill: Vol. 1, and most of
  them were in sequence

> In the last thirty minutes of Pulp Fiction, approximately, there
  were no deaths
