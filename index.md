## About

Hi! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science @ Purdue University, where I'm advised by the amazing Prof. [Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). Previously, I was a B.Sc. student (also in CS) @ UFMG, Brazil.

My interests lie broadly in Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science. More specifically, I'm interested in 

  1. Invariant models of graphs, sets and posets.
  2. Energy-based models.
  3. Stochastic optimization (MCMC methods).

More recently, I've also developed interest in connecting the above topics to random matrix theory and algebraic combinatorics.

Previously, I worked with distributed algorithms (@ UFMG) and Quantum Computing Theory (@ University of Calgary).

My CV (September/2020) is [here](CVsept2020.pdf)

The best way to read about my research is going to [my GoogleScholar profile](https://goo.gl/zrNQue). I try to maintain my repositories here at Github as up to date as possible. If you don't find what you are looking for here or if you have any extra questions about my research, drop me a line!
