Hi! I'm a Data Scientist based in [Curitiba](https://goo.gl/K1Qcdv) and
working in the Volvo Trucks Latin America, at the BI & Advanced
Analytics CoE.

I hold a BSc in Statistics and an MSc in Statistics and Numerical
Methods in Engineering, both @ [UFPR](https://goo.gl/DtVAbi). In
the masters, I handled mainly multivariate failure time data (also known
as multivariate survival / confiability data). You may take a look
[here](THESIS/thesis/thesis.pdf) at my thesis and [here
](THESIS/aqua/slides.pdf)( [.Rmd](THESIS/aqua/slides.Rmd) | [in_header
file](THESIS/aqua/beamerheader.txt) | [TikZ
style](THESIS/aqua/tikzit.sty)) at the defense slides.

My main interests lie in computational statistics and data analysis,
under 
- statistical modeling frameworks if the goal is to understand some
process;
- machine learning frameworks if the goal is prediction / forecasting.

Besides all that, I love to make pretty and useful visualizations 
(I ensembled some [here](visualizations/)).
