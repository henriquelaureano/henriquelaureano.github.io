Hi! I'm brazilian from [Curitiba](https://goo.gl/K1Qcdv), Statistician
(BSc in Statistics @ [UFPR](https://goo.gl/DtVAbi), 2016) and MSc
student in Numerical Methods in Engineering @ UFPR under the guidance of
Professor [Wagner Bonat](http://www.leg.ufpr.br/~wagner/) and Professor
[Paulo Justiniano](http://leg.ufpr.br/~paulojus/).

The best way to read about my research is going to [my GoogleScholar profile](https://goo.gl/zrNQue). I try to maintain my repositories here at Github as up to date as possible. If you don't find what you are looking for here or if you have any extra questions about my research, drop me a line!
