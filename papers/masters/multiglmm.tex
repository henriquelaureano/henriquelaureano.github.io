\begin{abstract}

  Clustered competing risks data are a complex failure time data
  scheme. Its main characteristics are the cluster structure, which
  implies a latent within-cluster dependence between its elements, and
  its multiple variables competing to be the one responsible for the
  occurrence of an event, the failure. To handle this kind of data, we
  propose a full likelihood approach, based on a generalized linear
  mixed model instead a usual complex frailty model. We model the
  competing causes in the probability scale, in terms of the cumulative
  incidence function (CIF). A multinomial distribution is assumed for
  the competing causes and censorship, conditioned on the latent
  effects. The latent effects are accommodated via a multivariate
  Gaussian distribution. The CIF is specified as the product of an
  instantaneous risk level function with a failure time trajectory level
  function. The estimation procedure is performed through the R package
  TMB (Template Model Builder), an \texttt{C++} based framework with
  efficient Laplace approximation and automatic differentiation
  routines. A large simulation study is performed, based on different
  latent structure formulations. The model presents to be of difficult
  estimation, with our results converging to a latent structure where
  both risk and failure time trajectory levels are correlated.

\section{Introduction}

Competing risks data, and more generally failure time data, can be
modeled in two possible scales: the hazard and the probability scale,
with the former being the most popular. A competing risks process can be
seen as the multivariate extension of a failure time process, having
multiple causes competing to be the one responsible for the desired
event occurrence, properly, a failure. In \autoref{fig:crp} a visual aid
is provided considering \(m\) competing causes.

Failure time data is the branch of Statistics responsible to handle
random variables describing the time until the occurrence of an event, a
failure \citep{kalb&prentice,hougaard00}. The time until a failure is
called survival experience, and is the modeling object. To accommodate
the number of possible causes for a failure there is the competing risks
data scheme. More specifically, its clustered version with groups of
elements sharing some non-observed latent dependence structure.

When this framework is applied in real-world situations, we have to be
able to handle with the nonoccurrence of the desired event, by any of
the competing causes, for, let us say, \textit{logistic reasons}
(short-time study and outside scope causes are some examples). This,
generally noninformative, nonoccurrence of the event is called
censorship.

When the elements under study are organized in clusters (a family,
e.g.), it opens space to what is called \textit{family studies}. In
family studies, the goal is to accommodate the non-observed latent
dependence and try to understand the relationship between the family
elements. In other words, how the occurrence of an event in a subject
affects the survival experience for the same or similar event in its
familiars.

The survival experiences is usually modeled in the hazard (failure rate)
scale, and with the latent within-cluster dependence accommodation we
have what is called a frailty model
\citep{frailty78,frailty79,liang95,petersen98}. The use of frailty
models implies in complicated likelihood functions and inference
routines done via elaborated and slow EM algorithms
\citep{nielsen92,klein92} or inefficient MCMC schemes
\citep{hougaard00}. With multiple survival experiences, the general idea
is the same but with even more elaborated likelihoods
\citep{prentice78,therneau00} or mixture model approaches
\citep{larson85,kuk92}.

When in the hazard scale, the interpretations are in terms of hazard
rates. A less usual scale but with a more appealing interpretation is
the probability scale. For competing risks data, the work on the
probability scale is done by means of the cumulative incidence function
(CIF) \citep{andersen12}, with the main modeling approach being the
subdistribution \citep{fine&gray}.

For clustered competing risks data there are some available options but
with a lack of predominance. The options vary in terms of likelihood
specification, with its majority being designed for bivariate CIFs,
where increasing the CIF's dimension is a limitation. Some of the
existing options are (i) nonparametric approaches
\citep{cheng07,cheng09}; (ii) linear transformation models
\citep{fine99,gerds12}; (iii) semiparametric approaches based on
composite likelihoods \citep{shih,SCHEIKE}, estimating equations
\citep{crossoddsratioSCHEIKE,cheng&fine}, copulas
\citep{semiparametricSCHEIKE}, and mixtures \citep{naskar05,shi13}.

Besides the interpretation, by modeling the CIF it is possible to
specify complex within-cluster dependence structures. We follow
\cite{SCHEIKE} and work with a CIF specification based on its
decomposition in instantaneous risk and failure time trajectory
functions, with both being cluster-specifics and possible correlated. As
a modeling framework, we use a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)
specification. Through a GLMM we have a straightforward full likelihood
specification, easy to virtually extend to any number of competing
causes, and capable to allow for complex CIF structures. To make the
estimation and inferential process the most efficient as possible we
take advantage of state-of-art computational libraries and efficiently
implemented routines under the \texttt{TMB} \citep{TMB} package of the R
\citep{R21} statistical software.

The class of generalized linear models (GLMs) \citep{GLM72} is probably
the most popular statistical modelling framework. Despite its
flexibility, the GLMs are not suitable for dependent data. For the
analysis of such data, \cite{laird82} proposed the random effects
regression models for longitudinal/repeated-measures data, and
\cite{breslow93} presented the GLMMs for the analysis of non-Gaussian
outcomes. In this framework, we can accommodate all competing causes of
failure and censorship under a multinomial probability distribution. The
latent within-cluster dependence is accommodated via a multivariate
normal distribution, and the cause-specific CIFs via the model's link
function.

The main goal of this work is to propose a GLMM approach to handle
clustered competing risks data with a flexible within-cluster dependence
structure. The model specification and the inferential routine are much
simpler than the usually used approaches, increasing its practical
relevance. The latent effects, the key complicator factor, are handled
out by means of an efficient Laplace approximation and automatic
differentiation routines. The main contributions of this article are:
(i) introducing the modeling of cause/cluster-specific CIFs of clustered
competing risks data into an efficient implementation of the GLMMs
framework; (ii) performing a extensive simulation study to check the
properties of the maximum likelihood estimator to learn the
cause-specific CIF forms and the feasibility of the within-cluster
dependence structure.; (iii) providing R code and \texttt{C++}
implementation for the used GLMMs.

The work is organized as follows. Section \ref{model} presents the CIF
specification and the multinomial GLMM. Section \ref{inference} presents
the estimation and inferential routines. Section \ref{simulation}
presents the performed simulation studies to check the model
viability. Finally, the main contributions of the article are discussed
in Section \ref{discussion}.

\section{Model}
\label{model}

\subsection{Cluster-specific cumulative incidence function (CIF)}
\label{CIF}

Consider that the observed follow-up time of a subject is given by \(T =
\min(T^{\ast},C)\), where \(T^{\ast}\) denote the failure time and \(C\)
denote the censoring time. Given the possible covariates \(\bm{x}\), for
a cause-specific of failure \(k\), the cumulative incidence function
(CIF) is defined as
\begin{align*}
 F_{k}(t \mid \bm{x})
 = \mathbb{P}[T \leq t,~K = k \mid \bm{x}]
 &= \int_{0}^{t} f_{k}(z \mid \bm{x})~\text{d}z\\
 &= \int_{0}^{t} \lambda_{k}(z \mid \bm{x})~S(z \mid \bm{x})
  ~\text{d}z, \quad t > 0, \quad k = 1,~\dots,~K,
\end{align*}
where \(f_{k}(t \mid \bm{x})\) is the (sub)density for the time to a
type \(k\) failure. The subdensity is composed by the cause-specific
hazard function or process \(\lambda_{k}(t \mid \bm{x})\), representing
the instantaneous rate for failures of type \(k\) at time \(t\) given
\(\bm{x}\) and all other failure types (competing causes). If we sum up
all cause-specific hazard functions we get the overall hazard function
\(\lambda(t \mid \bm{x})\). From the overall hazard function we arrive
in the overall survival function,
\[
 S(t \mid \bm{x}) = \mathbb{P}[T > t \mid \bm{x}] =
 \exp\left\{-\int_{0}^{t} \lambda(z \mid \bm{x})~\text{d}z\right\},
\]
the second function that compose the subdensity \(f_{k}(t \mid
\bm{x})\). A comprehensive reference for all these definitions is
the book of \cite{kalb&prentice}.

To take into consideration our clustered/family structure, we follow the
same CIF specification of \cite{SCHEIKE}. For two competing causes of
failure, the cause-specific CIFs are specified in the following manner
\begin{equation}
 F_{k} (t \mid \bm{x},~u_{1},~u_{2},~\eta_{k}) =
 \underbrace{\pi_{k}(\bm{x},~u_{1},~u_{2})}_{
 \substack{\text{cluster-specific}\\\text{risk level}}}\times
  \underbrace{\Phi[w_{k} g(t) - \bm{x}\bm{\gamma}_{k} - \eta_{k}]}_{
   \substack{\text{cluster-specific}\\\text{failure time trajectory}}
  }, \quad t > 0, \quad k = 1,~2,
  \label{eq:cif}
\end{equation}
i.e., as the product of a cluster-specific risk level with a
cluster-specific failure time trajectory, resulting in a
cluster-specific CIF. What makes these components cluster-specific are
\(\bm{u} = \{u_{1},~u_{2}\}\) and \(\bm{\eta} =
\{\eta_{1},~\eta_{2}\}\), Gaussian distributed latent effects with zero
mean and potentially correlated,
\[
 \begin{bmatrix} u_{1}\\u_{2}\\\eta_{1}\\\eta_{2} \end{bmatrix} \sim
 \parbox{2.5cm}{\centering Multivariate Normal}
 \left(
  \begin{bmatrix} 0\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix},
  \begin{bmatrix}
   \sigma_{u_{1}}^{2}&
   \text{cov}(u_{1},~u_{2})&
   \text{cov}(u_{1},~\eta_{1})&\text{cov}(u_{1},~\eta_{2})\\
   &\sigma_{u_{2}}^{2}&
   \text{cov}(u_{2},~\eta_{1})&\text{cov}(u_{2},~\eta_{2})\\
   &&\sigma_{\eta_{1}}^{2}&\text{cov}(\eta_{1},~\eta_{2})\\
   &&&\sigma_{\eta_{2}}^{2}
  \end{bmatrix}
 \right).
 \]

The cluster-specific risk levels are modeled by a multinomial logistic
regression model with latent effects, i.e.
\begin{equation}
 \pi_{k}(\bm{x}, \bm{u}) =
 \frac{\exp\{\bm{x}\bm{\beta}_{k} + u_{k}\}}{1 +
  \exp\{\bm{x}\bm{\beta}_{1} + u_{1}\} +
  \exp\{\bm{x}\bm{\beta}_{2} + u_{2}\}}, \quad k = 1,~2,
 \label{eq:risklevel}
\end{equation}
where the \(\bm{\beta}_{k}\)'s are the coefficients responsible for
quantifying the impact of the covariates in the cause-specific risk
levels. For individuals from the same cluster/family, at the same time
point, the \(\bm{\beta}_{k}\)s have the well-known odds ratio
interpretation.

The second component of \autoref{eq:cif} is the cluster-specific failure
time trajectory
\[
 \Phi[w_{k} g(t) - \bm{x}\bm{\gamma}_{k} - \eta_{k}],
 \quad t > 0, \quad k = 1,~2,
\]
where \(\Phi(\cdot)\) is the cumulative distribution function of a
standard Gaussian distribution. With regard to the function \(g(t)\), it
plays a crucial role since the proposed CIF separation is only possible
with it. It is used a time \(t\) transformation given by
\[
 g(t) = \text{arctanh}\left(\frac{t - \delta/2}{\delta/2}\right),
 \quad t\in(0,~\delta), \quad g(t)\in(-\infty,~\infty),
\]
where \(\delta\) depends on the data and cannot exceed the maximum
observed follow-up time \(\tau\), i.e. \(\delta \leq \tau\). With this
Fisher-based transformation the value of the cluster-specific failure
time trajectory is equal 1 at time \(\delta\). Consequently, \(F_{k}
(\delta \mid \bm{x},~\bm{u},~\eta_{k}) = \pi_{k}(\bm{x} \mid \bm{u})\)
and we can interpret \(\pi_{1}(\bm{x} \mid \bm{u})\) and
\(\pi_{2}(\bm{x} \mid \bm{u})\) as the cause-specific cluster-specific
risk levels at time \(\delta\). The cluster-specific survival function
is given by \(S(t \mid \bm{x},~\bm{u},~\bm{\eta}) = 1 - F_{1} (t \mid
\bm{x},~\bm{u},~\eta_{1}) - F_{2} (t \mid \bm{x},~\bm{u},~\eta_{2})\).

A direct understanding of all coefficients/parameters in
\autoref{eq:cif} can be reached via the top-placed illustrations in
\autoref{fig:cifcoefs}. We consider two competing causes, without
covariates, and plot the cluster-specific CIF of just one failure
cause. We see that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The \(\beta\)'s are related to the curve's maximum value, i.e.
   bigger the \(\beta\) highest the CIF;

 \item The \(\bm{\gamma}_{k}\)'s are the coefficients responsible for
   quantifying the impact of the covariates in the cause-specific
   failure time trajectories, i.e. the shape of the cumulative
   incidence. We see that the \(\gamma\)'s are also related with an idea
   of midpoint and consequently, growth speed. The fact that
   \(\gamma_{k}\) enters negatively in the cluster-specific failure time
   trajectory makes that a negative value causes an advance towards the
   curve, whereas a positive value causes a delay;

 \item Last but not least, the \(w\)'s. With negative values we have a
   decreasing curve and with positive values an increasing curve, the
   behavior of interest.
\end{itemize}
   
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/cifstudy-1.png}
 \vspace{-0.75cm}
 \caption{Curve behaviors for different parameter settings, showing then
   the corresponding parameter effects in a cluster-specific cumulative
   incidence function (CIF).}
 \label{fig:cifcoefs}
\end{figure}

Remains to talk about the within-cluster dependence induced by the
latent effects in \(\bm{u}\) and \(\bm{\eta}\). To help in the
discussion, the bottom-plots on \autoref{fig:cifcoefs} illustrates the
cluster-specific CIF for a given failure cause in a model without
covariates, let us call it failure cause 1 (in total we have two). The
latent effects \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) always appear together in the
cluster-specific risk level, as consequency they have a joint effect on
the cumulative incidence of both causes. As we can see in
\autoref{fig:cifcoefs}, an increase in \(u_{k}\) will increase the risk
of failure from cause \(k\). The interpretation of
\(\text{cov}(\eta_{1},~\eta_{2})\) and \(\text{cov}(u_{1},~u_{2})\) is
straightforward, and those values are in most of the cases positive, as
said in \cite{SCHEIKE}. With regard to \(\text{cov}(u_{k},~\eta_{k})\),
negative values are the common situation. A negative correlation between
\(\eta_{k}\) and \(u_{k}\) imply that when \(\eta_{k}\) decreases,
\(u_{k}\) increases and conversely when \(\eta_{K}\) increases,
\(u_{k}\) decreases. In other words, an increased risk level is reached
quickly and a decreased risk level is reached later, respectively. With
regard to cross-cause correlation between \(\eta\) and \(u\), positive
values are the common situation where late onset of one failure cause is
associated with a high absolute risk of another failure cause.

\subsection{Model specification}
\label{multiGLMM}

The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) for clustered competing risks
data is specified in the following hierarchical fashion. By simplicity,
we focus on two competing causes of failure but an extension is
straightforward. For two competing causes of failure, a subject \(i\),
in the cluster/family \(j\) and time \(t\), we have
\begin{align}
 y_{i j t} \mid \{u_{1j},~u_{2j},~\eta_{1j},~\eta_{2j}\}
 &\sim\text{Multinomial}(p_{1ijt},~p_{2ijt},~p_{3ijt})\nonumber\\
 \nonumber\\
 \begin{bmatrix} u_{1}\\u_{2}\\\eta_{1}\\\eta_{2} \end{bmatrix}
 &\sim\text{MN}
  \left(
   \begin{bmatrix} 0\\0\\0\\0 \end{bmatrix},
   \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{u_{1}}^{2}&
    \text{cov}(u_{1},~u_{2})&
    \text{cov}(u_{1},~\eta_{1})&\text{cov}(u_{1},~\eta_{2})\\
    &\sigma_{u_{2}}^{2}&
    \text{cov}(u_{2},~\eta_{1})&\text{cov}(u_{2},~\eta_{2})\\
    &&\sigma_{\eta_{1}}^{2}&\text{cov}(\eta_{1},~\eta_{2})\\
    &&&\sigma_{\eta_{2}}^{2}
   \end{bmatrix}
  \right)\nonumber\\
 \nonumber\\
 p_{kijt}
 &=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
  F_{k} (t \mid \bm{x},~u_{1},~u_{2},~\eta_{k})\label{eq:model}\\
 &= \frac{\exp\{\bm{x}_{kij}\bm{\beta}_{k} + u_{kj}\}}{
    1 + \sum_{m=1}^{K-1}\exp\{\bm{x}_{mij}\bm{\beta}_{m} + u_{mj}\}}
  \nonumber\\
 &\times w_{k}\frac{\delta}{2\delta t - 2t^{2}}~
  \phi\left(
   w_{k}
   \text{arctanh}\left(\frac{t-\delta/2}{\delta/2}\right)
   - \bm{x}_{kij}\bm{\gamma}_{k} - \eta_{kj}
  \right),\nonumber\\k = 1,~2.\nonumber
\end{align}
The probabilities are given by the derivative w.r.t. time \(t\) of the
cluster-specific CIF. The choice of a multinomial logistic regression
model ensures that the sum of all predicted cause-specific CIFs does not
exceed 1. Considering two competing causes of failure, we have a
multinomial with three classes. The third class exists to handle the
censorship and its probability is given by the complementary to reach
1. To better describe these curve behaviors we have
\autoref{fig:modelsample}.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/modelsample-1.png}
 \vspace{-0.75cm}
 \caption{Cluster-specific cumulative incidence function (CIF) curves
   and their derivatives (dCIF) for a random scenario with two competing
   causes.}
 \label{fig:modelsample}
\end{figure}

This framework in \autoref{eq:model} results in what we call multiGLMM,
a multinomial GLMM to handle the CIF of clustered competing risks
data. For a random sample, the corresponding marginal likelihood
function in given by
\begin{align}
 L(\bm{\theta}~;~y)
 &= \prod_{j=1}^{J}~\int_{\Re^{4}}
    \pi(y_{j} \mid \bm{r}_{j})\times\pi(\bm{r}_{j})~\text{d}\bm{r}_{j}
    \nonumber\\
 &= \prod_{j=1}^{J}~\int_{\Re^{4}}
    \Bigg\{
    \underbrace{\prod_{i=1}^{n_{j}}~\prod_{t=1}^{n_{ij}}
    \Bigg(
    \frac{(\sum_{k=1}^{K}y_{kijt})!}{y_{1ijt}!~y_{2ijt}!~y_{3ijt}!}~
    \prod_{k=1}^{K} p_{kijt}^{y_{kijt}}
    \Bigg)}_{\substack{\text{fixed effect component}}}
  \Bigg\}\times\nonumber\\
 &\hspace{2cm}\underbrace{
   (2\pi)^{-2} |\Sigma|^{-1/2} \exp
   \left\{-\frac{1}{2}\bm{r}_{j}^{\top} \Sigma^{-1} \bm{r}_{j}\right\}
   }_{\substack{\text{latent effect component}}}
   \text{d}\bm{r}_{j}\nonumber\\
 &= \prod_{j=1}^{J}~\int_{\Re^{4}}
    \Bigg\{
    \underbrace{\prod_{i=1}^{n_{j}}~\prod_{t=1}^{n_{ij}}
    \prod_{k=1}^{K} p_{kijt}^{y_{kijt}}
    }_{\substack{\text{fixed effect}}}
   \Bigg\}\underbrace{
   (2\pi)^{-2} |\Sigma|^{-1/2} \exp
   \left\{-\frac{1}{2}\bm{r}_{j}^{\top} \Sigma^{-1} \bm{r}_{j}\right\}
   }_{\substack{\text{latent effect component}}}
   \text{d}\bm{r}_{j}\label{eq:loglik},
\end{align}
where \(\bm{\theta} = [\bm{\beta}~\bm{\gamma}~\bm{w}~\bm{\sigma^{2}}~
  \bm{\rho}]^{\top}\) is the parameters vector to be maximized. In our
framework, a subject can fail from just one competing cause or get
censor, at a given time. Thus, the fraction of factorials in the fixed
effect component is made only by 0's and 1's. The matrix \(\Sigma\) is
the variance-covariance matrix, which parameters are given by
\(\bm{\sigma}^{2}\) and \(\bm{\rho}\).

To each cluster \(j\) we have a product of two components. The fixed
effect component, given by a multinomial distribution with its
probabilities specified through the cluster-specific CIF
(\autoref{eq:cif}) and, the latent effect component, given by a
multivariate Gaussian distribution. To each subject \(i\) that composes
a cluster \(j\) we have its specific fixed effects contribution. The
likelihood in \autoref{eq:loglik} is the most general as possible,
allowing for repeated measures to each subject. Since all subjects of a
given cluster shares the same latent effect, we have just one latent
effect contribution multiplying the product of fixed effect
contributions. As we do not observe the latent effect variables,
\(\bm{r}_{j}\), we integrate out in it. With two competing causes of
failure we have four latent effects, a multivariate Gaussian
distribution in four dimensions. Consequently, for each cluster, we
approximate an integral in four dimensions. The product of these
approximated integrals results in the called marginal likelihood, to be
maximized in \(\bm{\theta}\).

\section{Estimation and inference}
\label{inference}

Our goal is to estimate the parameter vector \(\bm{\theta} =
[\bm{\beta}~\bm{\gamma}~\bm{w}~\bm{\sigma^{2}}~ \bm{\rho}]^{\top}\). The
likelihood for \(\bm{\theta}\) can be written as
\begin{equation}
 L(\bm{\theta} \mid \bm{y,u}) =
 \prod_{i=1}^{I}~\prod_{j=1}^{n_{i}}~
 f(y_{ij} \mid \bm{u}_{i}, \bm{\beta,\Sigma})~
 f(\bm{u}_{i} \mid \bm{\Sigma}).
 \label{eq:joint}
\end{equation}
From standard probability theory is easy to see that in the right-hand
side (r.h.s.) we have a joint density, consequently, \autoref{eq:joint}
represents what is called a full or joint likelihood function. The
latent effect \(\bm{u}\) is \textit{latent}, i.e. we do not observe
it. To handle this we use the Laplace approximation.

If we have a joint density we can just integrate out the undesired
variable resulting in
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
  L(\bm{\theta} \mid \bm{y}) &=
  \prod_{i=1}^{I}~\int_{\mathcal{R}^{\bm{u}_{i}}}
  \left[~\prod_{j=1}^{n_{i}}~
         f(y_{ij} \mid \bm{u}_{i}, \bm{\beta,\Sigma})~
         f(\bm{u}_{i} \mid \bm{\Sigma})
  \right]\text{d} \bm{u}_{i}\\
  &= \prod_{i=1}^{I}~\int_{\mathcal{R}^{\bm{u}_{i}}}~
  f(\bm{y}_{i}, \bm{u}_{i} \mid \bm{\theta})~\text{d} \bm{u}_{i},
  \label{eq:generalmarginal}
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
a marginal density that keeps the parameters \(\{\bm{\sigma^{2}}~
\bm{\rho}\}\) of the integrated variable. To handle this integration
step a clever choice is to take advantage of the exponential family
structure together with the Gaussian latent effects distribution. These
ideas converge to an adaptive Gaussian quadrature with one integration
point, also known as \textit{Laplace approximation}
\citep{molenberghs&verbeke,LA4H,tierney,corestats}.

We may approximate a analytically intractable integral in a way to
obtain a tractable closed-form expression allowing the numerical
maximization of the resulting marginal likelihood function
\citep{patrao}. The Laplace approximation has been designed to
approximate integrals in the form
\begin{equation}
 \int_{\mathcal{R}^{\bm{u}_{i}}}
 \exp\{Q(\bm{u}_{i})\} \text{d} \bm{u}_{i}\approx
 (2\pi)^{n_{\bm{u}}/2}~
 |{Q}''(\bm{\hat{u}}_{i})|^{-1/2}~\exp\{Q(\bm{\hat{u}}_{i})\},
 \label{eq:laplace}
\end{equation}
where \(Q(\bm{u}_{i})\) is a known unimodal bounded function, and
\(\bm{\hat{u}}_{i}\) is the value for which \(Q(\bm{u}_{i})\) is
maximized. A advantage of the Laplace approximation approach in a GLMM
is the exponential family structure. In a usual GLMM the response
follows a one-parameter exponential family distribution that can be
written as
\[
 f(\bm{y}_{i} \mid \bm{u}_{i}, \bm{\theta}) =
 \exp \left\{
  \bm{y}_{i}^{\top} (\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{u}_{i}) -
  \bm{1}_{i}^{\top}b(\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{u}_{i}) +
  \bm{1}_{i}^{\top} c(\bm{y}_{i})
      \right\},
\]
where \(b(\cdot)\) and \(c(\cdot)\) are known functions. This general
and easy to compute expression together with a (multivariate) Gaussian
distribution, highlights the convenience of the Laplace method. The
\(Q(\bm{u}_{i})\) function to be maximized can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
  Q(\bm{u}_{i}) &=
  \bm{y}_{i}^{\top} (\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{u}_{i}) -
  \bm{1}_{i}^{\top}b(\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{u}_{i}) +
  \bm{1}_{i}^{\top} c(\bm{y}_{i})\\
  &- \frac{n_{\bm{u}}}{2} \log (2\pi) -
     \frac{1}{2} \log |\bm{\Sigma}| -
     \frac{1}{2} \bm{u}_{i}^{\top}\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}~\bm{u}_{i}.
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The approximation in~\autoref{eq:laplace} requires the maximum
\(\bm{\hat{u}}_{i}\) of the function \(Q(\bm{u}_{i})\). As we assume a
Gaussian distribution with a known mean for the latent effects, we have
the perfect initial guess for a Hessian-based maximization method, as
the Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm. \cite{patrao} presents the generic
expressions for the derivatives required by the NR method, given by the
following:
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
  {Q}'(\bm{u}_{i}^{(k)}) &=
  \{\bm{y}_{i} - {b}'(\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{u}_{i}^{(k)})
  \}^{\top} - {\bm{u}_{i}^{(k)}}^{\top} \bm{\Sigma}^{-1},\\
  {Q}''(\bm{u}_{i}^{(k)}) &=
  - \text{diag}\{{b}''(\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta}
  + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{u}_{i}^{(k)})\} - \bm{\Sigma}^{-1}.
 \end{aligned}
 \nonumber
\end{equation}

The marginal log-likelihood function returned by the Laplace
approximation, to each individual or unit under study \(i\), is as
follows:
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
  l(\bm{\theta} \mid \bm{y}_{i}) =
  \log L(\bm{\theta} \mid \bm{y}_{i}) &= \frac{n}{2} \log (2\pi) -
  \frac{1}{2} \log
  \left| \text{diag}\{{b}''(\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} +
                      \bm{z}_{i}\bm{\hat{u}}_{i})
                    \} + \bm{\Sigma}^{-1}
  \right|\\
  &+ \bm{y}_{i}^{\top}
     (\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{\hat{u}}_{i}) -
     \bm{1}_{i}^{\top}
     b(\bm{x}_{i}\bm{\beta} + \bm{z}_{i}\bm{\hat{u}}_{i}) +
     \bm{1}_{i}^{\top} c(\bm{y}_{i})\\
  &- \frac{n_{\bm{u}}}{2} \log (2\pi) -
     \frac{1}{2} \log |\bm{\Sigma}| - \frac{1}{2}
     \bm{\hat{u}}_{i}^{\top}\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}~\bm{\hat{u}}_{i},
 \end{aligned}
 \nonumber
\end{equation}
that can now be numerically maximized over the model parameters
\(\bm{\theta} = [\bm{\beta}~\bm{\gamma}~\bm{w}~\bm{\sigma^{2}}~
  \bm{\rho}]^{\top}\) using a quasi-Newton method as the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm \citep{nocedal&wright}
or the PORT routines \citep{PORTpaper,PORTreport}, all available in the
R \citep{R21} statistical software.

We use an efficient Laplace approximation routine implemented in
\texttt{TMB} \citep{TMB}. Besides state-of-art linear algebra libraries
and the possibility of performing the computations in parallel,
\texttt{TMB} also offers an efficient implementation of automatic
differentiation \citep{nocedal&wright,corestats,peyre}, the state-of-art
in gradients computation. In \texttt{TMB} the user should write its
likelihood function in a \texttt{C++} template file and then load it on
R. This last characteristic makes \texttt{TMB} general (a vast range of
models being allowed to be written) and powerful (low-level \texttt{C++}
model implementation).

\section{Simulation studies}
\label{simulation}

To verify the practical viability of our model we performed an extensive
simulation study. As main complicator factors, we may mention the
competing causes un balancement, where we typically have much more
censorships than actual failures; and the high dimensionality problem,
having a considerable number of parameters to estimate in both fixed and
latent effects layers.

One of the main questions surrounding our model that we tried to tack
down in this study was, if even when in the possession of a high
correlated sample in the latent field, we are able to estimate all
variance and covariance parameters.

One of the main questions surrounding our model that we tried to tack
down in this study was, if even when in the possession of a high
correlated sample in the latent field, we are able to estimate all
variance and covariance parameters. To answer this question we worked
with four different models, with each one differentiating from the other
in terms of latent effects structure. We had a model with (i) latent
effects only on the risk level; (ii) only on the failure time trajectory
level; (iii) on both levels but without cross-correlations, called a
blog-diag model; and (iv) a model with all possible correlations
presented, called as a complete model. In \autoref{fig:matrix} a visual
representation of these latent effects structures is presented, in terms
of the corresponding variance-covariance matrices.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/matrix-1.png}
 \vspace{-0.75cm}
 \caption{Simulation study variance-covariance matrix model designs,
   considering two competing causes of failure and consequently, four
   latent effects.}
 \label{fig:matrix}
\end{figure}

Besides the four latent effects structures, we worked with two CIF
configurations
\begin{align*}
 \text{High CIF configuration}:~&\quad
 \{\beta_{1} = -2,~\beta_{2} = -1.5,~\gamma_{1} = 1,~\gamma_{2} = 1.5,~
   w_{1} = 3,~w_{2} = 4
 \};\\
 \text{Low CIF configuration}:~&\quad
 \{\beta_{1} = 3,~\beta_{2} = 2.5,~\gamma_{1} = 2.6,~\gamma_{2} = 4,~
   w_{1} = 5,~w_{2} = 10
 \}.
\end{align*}

Those two sets of parameter values together with the following
variance-covariance structure values arise in CIF curves with peaks
around 0.15 (low incidence scenario) and 0.60 (high incidence scenario).
For numerical efficiency reasons, we worked with the log-variances and
the Fisher-z-transformation of the correlation parameters.

\begin{minipage}{0.15\textwidth}
 \begin{align*}
  \sigma_{u_{1}}^{2}   &= 1\\
  \sigma_{u_{2}}^{2}   &= 0.7\\
  \sigma_{\eta_{1}}^{2} &= 0.6\\
  \sigma_{\eta_{2}}^{2} &= 0.9,
 \end{align*}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.85\textwidth}
 \[
  \text{Correlation structure}~=~\begin{blockarray}{ccccc}
                                  u_{1} & u_{2} & \eta_{1} & \eta_{2}\\
                                  \begin{block}{(cccc)c}
                                   1 & 0.1 & -0.5 &  0.3 & u_{1}\\
                                     &   1 &  0.3 & -0.4 & u_{2}\\
                                     &     &    1 &  0.2 & \eta_{1}\\
                                     &     &      &    1 & \eta_{2}\\
                                  \end{block}
                                 \end{blockarray}.
 \]
\end{minipage}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent
We also considered three cluster sizes (2, 5, and 10) and three sample
sizes (5000, 30000, and 60000). We had 72 scenarios (4 latent effects
structures \(\times\) 2 CIF configurations \(\times\) 3 cluster sizes
\(\times\) 3 sample sizes). For each scenario, we simulate 500
samples. In total, 36000 (72 \(\times\) 500) model fittings. In the
smallest scenario, we had 500 clusters, in the biggest one, 30000
clusters. The number of clusters is the number of Laplace approximations
to be performed. With two competing causes of failure, we have a model
with 16 parameters (6 in the fixed effect layer, 3 for each competing
cause; and 10 in the latent effects layer, 4 variances, and 6 covariance
parameters).

All models were run, in a parallelized fashion, in one of the two
following Linux systems:
\begin{description}
 \item[System 1] 12 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @2.20GHz processors
   with 16GB RAM;
 \item[System 2] 30 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690v2 @3.00GHz processors
   and 206GB RAM.
\end{description}

The non-complete models (involving 2D Laplace approximations) are kind
of fast, taking always less than 5 minutes of processing. In the most
expensive scenarios (30K 4D Laplaces), the complete model takes 30
minutes. In terms of parameters estimation, the non-complete models fail
to learn the data. They appear to be not structured enough to capture
the data characteristics, showing that a full correlated latent field is
really the most appropriate choice.

In the supplementary materials, we have several graphs summarizing the
parameters estimate bias. In each figure, we have the estimate bias and
its uncertainty described by a Wald-based confidence interval,
i.e. \(\pm\) 1.96 the bias standard deviation. We chose to use this
uncertainty representation based on the point estimates instead of the
standard error computations, since in several scenarios the model fails
to compute all the standard errors, caused by Hessian numerical
instabilities.

When we assume a non-zero cross-correlation structure (complete model),
the improvements in terms of bias reduction are huge when compared with
the non-complete models. The mean biases get very close to zero, the
standard deviations decrease 50\% or more, compared with the
non-complete models, and the high CIF scenarios are the ones with a much
smaller bias-variance. All this is accomplished through the
consideration of the cross-correlations.

In the \textit{simpler} models, with a latent structure just in one
level, is hard to see some significant difference between the clusters
and sample sizes. With the complete model, in the other hand, the
difference is clear: as we increase the clusters and the sample sizes,
the bias-variance decreases. The mean-bias is basically always the same.
The biggest bias-variances are obtained in the log-variances. A final
remark to be made is about convergences. With the simpler models, not
all of them work, having in some scenarios (generally the ones with 60
thousand data points) a 50\(\sim\)60\% convergence rate. With the
complete model, basically, almost all fits reach convergence
(\(\sim\)95\% performance).

About the implied mean-CIF curves, in \autoref{fig:cifshigh} we have the
high CIF scenario curves and in \autoref{fig:cifslow} the low CIF
scenario curves. Since for all models we have a latent structure for the
within-cluster dependency, the inherent idea is that this also affect
the fixed-effect parameter estimates. By taking its average in each of
the seventy-two scenarios, we are able to construct the mean CIF curves.

   and 60K means the sample size.}
 \label{fig:cifshigh}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:cifshigh} is clear that with the complete model we get a
perfect fit in all scenarios. The risk and time models estimate well the
curve shape parameters but they fail to learn the max incidence. A
compensation between curves is clear. In the low CIF scenarios in
\autoref{fig:cifslow}, the estimation is clearly more difficult. The
overall fits are bad. For one of the failure causes, the estimation
quality is not so bad. The problem is when we look to the other. The
best joint fit is still with the complete model.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

The general goal of this paper was the proposition and evaluation of a
maximum likelihood estimation approach for the analysis of clustered
competing risks data. Focused on the probability scale, by means of the
cumulative incidence function (CIF), instead of the usual hazard scale
\citep{kalb&prentice}. We model the clustered competing risks on a
latent-effects framework, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)
\citep{GLMM}, with a multinomial distribution for the competing risks
and censorship, conditioned on the latent-effects. The within-cluster
latent dependency is accommodated by a multivariate Gaussian
distribution.

The failures by the competing causes and their respective censorships
are modeled by means of the CIF \citep{kalb&prentice,andersen12}. The
CIF is accommodated in our GLMM framework in terms of the link function
\citep{GLM89}, as the product of two functions, one responsible to model
the instantaneous risk and the other the failure time trajectory, both
in a cluster-specific fashion. This particular GLMM formulation is what
makes our model, particular. Thus, we have what we call a multiGLMM: a
multinomial GLMM for clustered competing risks data.

The two-function product CIF formulation was taken from \cite{SCHEIKE}
but there they use a different estimation framework, a composite
likelihood framework \citep{lindsay88,cox&reid04,varin11}. Here we do a
full likelihood analysis instead. A composite approach is generally used
when a full likelihood approach is impossible or computationally
impracticable. Our goal here was to assess a full likelihood framework
taking advantage of state-of-the-art computational libraries together
with efficient algorithm implementations. We have all this with the R
\citep{R21} package \texttt{TMB} \citep{TMB}.

The applications in focus here were family studies. Besides the
within-cluster/family dependence, this kind of study is characterized by
involving big samples, generally, populations. Also, generally having a
high number of small clusters, families, and a lot of censorship. A
maximum likelihood approach with the use of efficiently implemented
Laplace approximations \citep{tierney,patrao} together with an automatic
differentiation (AD) \citep{corestats,nocedal&wright} routine, all via
\texttt{TMB}, is able to efficiently handle with a high number of
clusters, independent of its size. The multinomial distribution
assumption, on its own, is an excellent probabilistic choice since it
can accommodate virtually any number of competing causes of failure and
its censorship. The presence of those two characteristics in our
multiGLMM makes it an efficient and scalable modeling framework for
clustered competing risks data.

Even with our modeling framework being virtually able to handle any
number of competing causes of failure, we restrained ourselves to work
here with only two of them. With two competing causes, we have
a \(4\times4\) covariance matrix for the latent effects, which implies
ten covariance parameters, which is already a lot of parameters to be
estimated in a latent structure. Since our goal was to assess the
viability of the maximum likelihood estimation method, we kept it with
two causes.

The so-called complete model, with latent effects on both risk and
failure time trajectory levels with cross-correlations, presented the
best results. In its biggest scenario, with 60000 data points and
clusters of size 2, i.e. 30000 four-dimension integral approximations,
the model fitting takes 30 minutes, in parallel. Before \texttt{TMB}, we
did a complete R implementation writing our own Laplace approximation
\citep{patrao} and Newton-Raphson gradients and Hessian, by hand. In a
scenario with 20000 data points and clusters of size 2, it took around
30 hours, in parallel. In summary, by using \texttt{TMB} we were able to
increase the model size 3 times and to decrease the computational time
60 times. An incredible performance gain.

Also with the complete model, we performed a Bayesian analysis via
\texttt{tmbstan} \citep{tmbstan}. \texttt{tmbstan} enables MCMC sampling
\citep{MCMC, Diaconis} from a \texttt{TMB} model object using Stan
\citep{Stan, RStan}. Sampling was performed based on the probably
state-of-art MCMC sampler algorithm, a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
algorithm with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) extension
\citep{NUTS-HMC}. We performed just one Bayesian model fitting in a
modest scenario with 5000 data points and clusters of size 2. It took
around 1 whole week of parallelized processing. The results were
basically the same as the ones obtained with \texttt{TMB} but this high
computational time just reinforces the MCMC framework limitation.

We proposed an ideally complete latent-effects formulation. The main
underlying idea of the simulation study was to see in which scenarios we
would be able to learn all the involved mean and covariance
parameters. As part of that, simpler formulations were proposed. As
result, we got that latent effects only in the risk level did not
work. The optimization appears to get lost as if something is
missing. Inserting latent effects only in the failure time trajectory
level returned better results, but still not satisfactorily good. In
most of the evaluated scenarios, the block-diagonal model appeared to be
in the middle of them, as a compromise. The best results (smallest
parameter estimates biases) were obtained with the complete model. The
complete model works fine, mainly in the scenarios of high CIF
configuration, and also as expected, as the sample size increases.

As an alternative to our model, we have two possible paths. We could
instead of a conditional modeling framework (GLMM/latent-effects model),
employ a marginal modeling framework. In this framework, instead of
caring about the specification of a probability distribution to the
competing causes conditioned on the latent effects, we just care about
the specification of a mean and a variance structure. This approach does
not have a likelihood function per se, but the estimation procedure
tends to be easier than with the GLMM one. A marginal modeling framework
that can be used here is the multivariate covariance generalized linear
model (McGLM) \citep{mcglm, rmcglm}. How to exactly model the CIF of
clustered competing risks data in this framework, is something to still
be figured out.

The other path is by the use of a different way of modeling the
dependence structure. Instead of a latent-effects approach, we could use
copulas \citep{copulas,semiparametricSCHEIKE,gcmr,factorcopulas}. How to
do that is something to still be figured out  in terms of which kind
(conditional or marginal) and version (Archimedean-, Gauss-, Maltesian-,
\(t\)-, hyperbolic-, zebra-, and elliptical-) of copula to use, besides
the estimability issue.
