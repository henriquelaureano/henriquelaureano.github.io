\begin{abstract}

  Clustered competing risks data are a complex failure time data
  scheme. Its main characteristics are the cluster structure, which
  implies a latent within-cluster dependence between its elements, and
  its multiple variables competing to be the one responsible for the
  occurrence of an event, the failure. To handle this kind of data, we
  propose a full likelihood approach, based on a generalized linear
  mixed model instead a usual complex frailty model. We model the
  competing causes in the probability scale, in terms of the cumulative
  incidence function (CIF). A multinomial distribution is assumed for
  the competing causes and censorship, conditioned on the latent
  effects. The latent effects are accommodated via a multivariate
  Gaussian distribution. The CIF is specified as the product of an
  instantaneous risk level function with a failure time trajectory level
  function. The estimation procedure is performed through the R package
  TMB (Template Model Builder), an \texttt{C++} based framework with
  efficient Laplace approximation and automatic differentiation
  routines. A large simulation study is performed, based on different
  latent structure formulations. The model presents to be of difficult
  estimation, with our results converging to a latent structure where
  the risk and failure time trajectory levels are correlated.

\section{Introduction}

Regression models are the main statistical tool for investigating the
relationship between a response variable and a set of explanatory
variables. The class of generalized linear models~(GLMs)~\citep{GLM72}
is probably the most popular statistical modelling framework to deal
with Gaussian and non-Gaussian outcomes. Despite its flexibility, the
GLMs are not suitable for . In general, .

The analysis of is generally performed by the . Besides that, other
. Some examples are the . Additionally, .

Although these models are useful in many applications, they are usually
limited to analyze independent data. In the case of longitudinal data,
it is essential that the regression model take into account the
longitudinal and/or grouped data structure. According to \cite{}
longitudinal data are repeated measures evaluated on the same subjects
over time, that are potentially correlated. Dependent data can also
arises in studies with block designs, spatial and multilevel data. For
the analysis of such data several methods have been proposed over the
last four decades.

\cite{laird82} proposed the random effects regression models for
longitudinal data analysis. \cite{breslow93} presented the generalized
linear mixed models~(GLMMs) for the analysis of non-Gaussian
outcomes. \cite{gcmr} developed a class of marginal models for modelling
dependence structures in the analysis of longitudinal data, time series
and spatial based on Gaussian copula models.

The main goal of this study is to propose the . In this paper, we will
investigate the as an alternative to . R \citep{R21} package
\texttt{TMB} \citep{TMb}.

The main contributions of this article are: (i) introducing the unit
gamma distribution into the GLMMs framework; (ii) performing a extensive
simulation study to check the properties of the the maximum likelihood
estimator to deal with longitudinal continuous bounded outcomes; (iii)
applying the proposed model in two data sets from different fields of
application; (iv) providing R code and \texttt{C++} implementation for
the unit gamma mixed models.

The work are organized as follows. Finally, the main contributions of
the article are discussed in Section .
