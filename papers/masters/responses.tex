  List of responses to the comments for the author of:
  A multinomial generalized linear mixed model for clustered competing
  risks data

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Associate Editor}

The manuscript has been read by two independent reviewers and myself. It
proposes a GLMM approach to handle clustered competing risks with a
within-cluster dependence structure.

As you can see below, the manuscript has been positively evaluated, but
there are still some issues that must be addressed. In particular, the
authors should specify the differences with the existing literature and,
especially, with the work by Cederkivst et.al. (2019) that seems to have
proposed a very similar model.

\subsection*{Author's response}

We are very grateful for the positive evaluation and clarified in the
paper the differences between our work and \cite{SCHEIKE}, these
clarifications were made in the introduction.

In summary, the differences are: we follow \cite{SCHEIKE} and work with
the Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) specification proposed by
them. However, there, to be able to model and infer the CIF parameters
and within-cluster dependence, an elaborated composite likelihood
approach was proposed together with an Adaptative Gaussian Quadrature
(AGQ) scheme to marginalize the composite likelihood. Extra steps were
needed to take to be able to quantify the uncertainty around the
parameters. We, on the other side, modeled the same CIF specification
via a much simpler and known formulation - a generalized linear mixed
model (GLMM) formulation. Besides the simpler formulation (which also
provides a full and proper likelihood function) we used a Laplace
approximation scheme, simpler, in contrast to the used AGQ. To make this
much simpler framework feasible, we took advantage of state-of-the-art
numerical algorithms implementations and computational
libraries. Basically, is the safe CIF specification but with different
likelihood functions/formulations and parameter estimation
routines/schemes.

\section*{Reviewer #1}

This is an interesting topic, and the authors reports an extended
simulation study while proposing an estimation methods for competing
risks with clustered data following the proposal by Cedervisk et al
(2019). The author should specify with more detail differences, if they
are present, between their proposal and the original one not only from
the computational side: they declare to propose a new model but it seems
the one proposed by Cedervisk et al.

I suggest adding some short motivations could add applicative values,
examples on the usage of this class of models that could help readers to
figure out in a clearer way the possible applications.

The simulations results underline some situation that can be
problematic. This is very interesting because in the original proposal
by Cedervisk et al only a real data set and a single simulation study
were considered, I suggest stressing this point and add some comparisons
with the previous proposal.  Especially for problematic situations, have
they tried to consider the original computational method proposed by
Cedervisk et al?  Can they give more insight for simulation cases where
the latent effects didn't work well?

\section*{Reviewer #2}

This paper proposes a multinomial mixed model (similar to a pattern
mixture model) for the cumulative incidence functions of clustered
multivariate competing risks data. Inference is based on the
(Laplace-approximated) maximum likelihood. The methods are rigorously
developed and could be useful in practice. I have a few minor comments
to help the authors improve the paper.

1. In simple language, what is the main difference of the proposed
approach with Cederkvist et al. (2019)?

2. Recently, Ahn et al. (2022) has proposed a robuts approach to
semiparametric regression of multivariate clustered competing risks
data. Can you comment on the similarities and differences with the
proposed method (a parametric one if I understand it correctly)?

3. The Laplace-approximated maximum likelihood looks similar to the EM
algorithm with the latent variables u_i treated as missing data. Can you
clarify the difference?
